"Ay
Fonsi
DY
Oh
Oh no, oh no
But how'd we get in this position
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
Go
Yes, you know that I
have been looking at you for a while I have to dance with you today (DY)
I saw that your gaze was already calling
me Show me the way I am going (Oh)
You, you are the magnet and I am the metal
I am getting closer and I'm putting together the plan
just thinking about the pulse quickens (Oh yeah)
Now, I am already liking it more than normal
All my senses are asking for more
This has to be taken without any rush
Despacito
want to breathe your neck slowly
Let me tell you things to your ear
for you to remember if you are not with me
Despacito
want to undress slowly kisses
signed in the walls of your maze
and make your body a whole manuscript (up, up, up)
(Up, up)
I want to see your hair dance ..."
